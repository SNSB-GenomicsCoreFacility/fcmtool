# fcmtool
A Python script that takes in the folder generated by flow cytometers tool and create per-species HTML reports from cluster assignments and a YAML configuration file. The script processes your dataset, identfies the peaks associated with G1 and G2 phase in the control sample as well as in test sample, estimates the genome size of the test sample using the information supplied in the yaml file, and writes one HTML file per species into a folder called "species_html" inside your data directory.

## üì¶ Requirements

The scripts depend on the following Python packages:
- pandas
- jinja2
- pyyaml

Install them with:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage
Command-line

Run the generator directly:
```
python generate_output_html.py <data_folder> <cluster_csv> <config_yaml>
```

### Arguments:
<data_folder> ‚Üí Folder containing your input data files.
<cluster_csv> ‚Üí CSV file with cluster assignments (species IDs to clusters).
<config_yaml> ‚Üí YAML configuration file defining template variables or settings.

### Example:
```
python generate_species_html.py ./data ./clusters.csv ./config.yaml
```
Outputs are written to:
```
<data_folder>/species_html/
```

## üñ•Ô∏è GUI Wrapper
To avoid typing commands, run the GUI wrapper:
```
python gui_generate_species_html.py
```

### Features:

 - File pickers for data folder, cluster CSV, and config YAML.
 - Lets you choose an output directory for the HTML files.
 -  Displays logs (stdout + stderr) from the generator script.
